## Chapter 2: Lexical Structure

Literals are values that appear in our programs:
- 1
- "Hello World"
- 3.14

Identifiers are name, they are used to name constants, variables, functions, classes, fields, labels for some loops.

Identifiers can start with letters, $, and \_, followed by any valid Unicode character

There are two sort of comments:

```javascript
// single line comment

/* 
 * Multi lines comment
 */
```

Semicolon is used to separate two statements, if they are in separate lines the use is optional.

```javascript
let a; // semicolon is optional
let b; // semicolon is optional
```

```javascript
let a; let b; // semicolon is required
```
