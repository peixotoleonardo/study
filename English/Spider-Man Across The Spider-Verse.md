Let's do things differently this time.
Like, so differently.
His name is Miles Morales.
He was bitten by a radioactive spider.
And he's not the only one.
He hasn't always had it easy.
And he's not the only one.
And now he's on his own
And he's not the only one.
You think you know the rest.
You don't.
I thought knew the rest, but...
I didn't.
I didn't want to hurt him.
But I did.
And he's not the only one.

Hey!
Yo, Deaf Leopard!
Gwen!
Is the song over?
Seems over. Are you okay?
You don't hang out, and you don't want to talk.
I didn't join a band so I could talk about my feelings.
Well, I did. I joined it so I could hit my feelings with sticks.
Yo. If you don't tell someone what's going on, you're gonna snap.
I'm fine.
That's not how someone who's fine would say that.
They'd say, "I'm great. Thanks. How are you?"
I'm great. Thanks. How are you?
Fine?
Gwen, come on. I don't get you, man.
You're right.
I play drums.

I always wanted to be in a band.
Guess I just never found the right one.
In this line of work, you always wind up a solo act.
Before Miles, there was Peter.
I think you look great.
I don't know.
Is this that dangerous menace?
No, no, no.
She seems like a good guy.
Why wear a mask if you've got nothing to hide, huh?
All right, no politics at the dinner table.
Mn, thank you, May.
But they didn't really know me.
And I didn't really know him either.
Touch him again, Ned. Gwen, it's okay.
Until it was too late.
Hey, Gwen. Hey!
Peter?
What? No.
No, no, no
What did you do?
I just wanted to be special.
Like you
Gwen
Gwen? Don't worry.
Who's Gwen
Everything's gonna be okay.
Don't.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Don't go.
Oh Peter.
