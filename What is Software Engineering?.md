We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering:
- time
- scale
- the trade-offs at play.

Software engineering is programming integrated over time. The addition of time adds an important new dimension to programming. Software engineering isn't programming.

The distinction between software engineering and programming is at the core of what we call **sustainability** for software. Your project is sustainable if, for the expected **life span** of your software, you are capable of reacting to whatever valuable change comes along, for either technical or business reasons. When you are fundamentally incapable of reacting to a change in underlying technology or product direction, you're placing a high-risk bet on the hope that such a change never becomes critical. For short-term projects, that might be a safe bet. Over multiple decades, it probably isn't.
